This repository is created by Harsh Panchal on 26 March 2025 at 12:15 IST. Please Find the simulator code and feel free to edit and made the project a grand success.

Note to my fellow collaborators:
1. Most of the code will remain same after Rtype is done.
2. The code is made scalable as much as possible.
3. Please make classes of each instruction similiar to Rtype.
4. Understand the Rtype code first then you can do the rest easily.
5. Hope this help , good luck to all collaborators.
